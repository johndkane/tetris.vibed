# About Tetris Vibed

This Tetris clone was vibe-coded in **ChatGPT** by re-prompting for fixes and features and saving out the complete new code each time, until it ran with correct gameplay and as expected. I didn't edit or write any code.

This is a PDF of the [complete prompt session](tetris-prompted.pdf). I started with a less capable Open AI model by accident but completed it using `o4-mini-high` because it's labeled as being good at coding.

# Run the game

Install the requirements:

* Install Python 3\* on your system
* Install pygame:

```bash
> pip install pygame
```

Download and Tetris script from this repo and run it:

```bash
> python tetris.py
```

\* *The version of Python I had installed was 3.13.3*
